    narrator """
    Aunt Mildred leans over the car window to give my shoulder a small reassuring pat before making her way inside, and as I watch her enter the store I notice her lurch on occasion, almost as if merely the act of walking was enough to cause her pain.

    What isn’t she telling me? Feeling my brows furrow with concern, I step out of the car and take a seat on the small bench propped up near the front door, waiting to help Aunt Mildred as soon as she steps out.

    The minutes seem to drag on as I sit there playing on my phone, the pale yellow sun starting to turn into a darker orange hue with still no signs of my aunt.

    As a small notification warning me of my phone’s low battery flashes across my screen I sigh and stuff the phone back in my pockets, my legs beginning to rock back and forth in an anxious rhythm.

    This isn’t like her. My aunt was always one to speak her mind, as if fearless.

    To her, it didn’t matter whether you were the mayor himself or some sort of raunchy tourist, if she had a problem with you, she would let you know.

    She was honest, painfully honest, much to my parents, and my uncle’s misfortunes. Yet it was this profound honesty that made her so good at giving advice.

    When I was little I was a bit of a nervous wreck, my parents were going through a pretty rough patch in their marriage and their fighting was starting to take its toll on me.

    By the time I had first visited my aunt and uncle I was so wrapped up in my own thoughts and trying to establish my own mental defenses that I ended up being too scared to talk to anybody.

    My young mind worried that any interactions with people I didn’t know would result in a fight similar to the ones my parents had.

    My Aunt Mildred noticed this, and through her advice, and so during our daily visits she would try and do what my parents didn’t do.

    She would play with me, talk with me, and make me feel welcome.

    If she sensed something was wrong she would encourage me to speak my mind, trying her best to make me feel calm and at ease.

    She wanted me to know that I didn’t have to hide anything from her, that she wouldn’t grow angry or treat me like my parents.

    There was no screaming around my Aunt Mildred, there were no flying plates thrown over ducking heads or nights without food after some dumb argument.

    There was only her and that toothy smile of hers, the long walks we had throughout the nearby forest, the scent of warm ovens and freshly made cookies filling her home.

    I had found peace, and although I knew each visit was only temporary, I could go back home everyday knowing that my aunt would be nearby if I ever needed anything.

    Thanks to her, once I started going to school I could finally speak up, having grown stronger, more confident.

    I was no longer afraid because I had felt that even if the whole world would grow to hate me I would still have someplace that I could call home.

    Under her care, I had reached a level of confidence that I hadn’t thought possible beforehand, allowing me to ignore all of the mess that was happening with my parents back home, and likewise prompting me to confide in Aunt Mildred for nearly everything.

    To Aunt Mildred—No, to the both of us, honesty was crucial, it was important; and as I jump up to my feet, sick of the crummy bench and beginning to stumble towards the grocery store on numbed legs, I can’t help but wonder what about her health could have been so severe as to warrant her hiding it from me.
    """

    narrator """
    The automatic doors sliding apart as I make my way inside, I see Aunt Mildred standing at the front counter, seemingly arguing with the cashier.

    Joining the conversation too late to fully understand what the pair were talking about, I notice her point further down the store towards the pharmacist, its shutters closed with what appeared to be a small paper attached to them.
    """

    mc "\"It looked like the two of you were fighting.\""

    aunt "\"No! No, no, no! Not at all! I’m just—I mean we’re just…\""

    narrator "Not being able to think up an excuse for her situation, Aunt Mildred lets out a defeated sigh and slumps her shoulders. She looks down at her wristwatch and, seeing the time, she lets out a small curse under her breath and looks back up to me."

    aunt "\"Aw damn, I’m sorry honey, you’ve been out there waiting for a while now haven’t you? I’ve been meaning to visit the pharmacist but he’s been out for lunch longer then he said he would and won’t be back till another half hour. \""

    aunt "\"Normally I’d just come back tomorrow but I can’t this time. It’s important.\""

    mc "\"Wait, really? Aunt Millie, what happened? Is it something that bad? Do you need me to help?\""

    narrator "\"Worried, I start trying to approach her but she holds up a hand and bids me to give her some space.\""

    aunt "\"Honey, I promise that as soon as we get home I’ll explain everything. But for now I just, I just need to settle this thing on my own; and besides, this is your first day back! You shouldn’t spend it all worrying about me!\""

    aunt "\"Go out there! Take a look around town and see if it’s still how you remember it. I’mma need to sit here and wait for a bit longer anyway, but as soon as I get these things sorted out we can head back home, I promise!\""

    narrator """
    Despite having regained her composure and trying her best to appease my worries with a smile, I can’t help but notice a tinge of sadness laced across my aunt’s tired eyes.

    Not wanting to pressure her any further, I nod and give her a hug.
    """

    mc "\"Half an hour right?\""

    aunt "\"Half an hour, I promise. Cashier says that any longer than that and they’ll start docking the pharmacist’s pay so he’ll be here, I promise.\""

    With that settled, I start making my way towards the door, a warm summer breeze rushing towards my face as I step out onto the streets of St. Marie.

    scene b_street_corner_2

    narrator """
    Standing in front of the grocery store, I look past the small groups of roving locals as I survey the town, and as my eyes glance over familiar faces and the signs of storefronts I hadn’t seen in years, I could feel a wave of long-forgotten memories wash over me.

    I was home, the place I had yearned for, the place I had dreamed of, I was back where I belonged. But things weren’t the same, nor could they ever be.

    The chipped paint and the growing cracks of the aging storefronts, to me, served as telltale signs of how long I had been gone for; and with every sight and childhood memory that came rushing into mind, I can’t help but notice just how many of them I had spent with my uncle.

    Treading the path that we had walked countless times before, I find a memory plastered upon every alley and street corner, reminding me of him and how things used to be.
    """

    scene b_street_corner_blackwhite

    narrator """
    I was almost inseparable from him, wanting to follow him no matter where he went or what he was doing. He had cared for me as if I were his own child, and I had felt safer in his and my Aunt Mildred’s care then I had ever felt back home with my own parents.

    Every morning before school, when the sky was still gray and the sun was just beginning to poke its head over the horizon, my uncle would take me for walks through Main Street,

    the cool and misty breeze of the nearby ocean causing me to huddle close to him for warmth and comfort.

    I would watch as he would stop by the same few stores to talk to their owners, close friends of his that he had known since childhood, as they began to set up shop.

    I was too young at the time to actually understand or care about any of the things they were talking about, the words that adults had used and the topics they liked to discuss were so strange and made no sense.

    But, not wanting to make my uncle upset, I would always try to be on my best behavior and to be as patient as possible;

    figuring that, since I could visit and spend time with my uncle whenever I’d like, it would be pretty rude of me to try and use up any of the time that he had left to spend with his friends.

    Yet despite my best efforts, my uncle’s frequent conversations with old townsfolk always ended up being the most boring part of our walks together.

    No matter how many times I tried to think up a game to distract myself, no matter how many times my uncle would reassure me that the next shop visit would be the last one, I would always end this little tour of Main Street in a fit of childish annoyance.

    Luckily for the both of us, by the time that the earliest signs of my inpatient temper tantrum began to set in, we would be nearing the outskirts of Main Street and the penultimate stop of our town-wide trip.
    """
    scene diner_exterior_blackwhite
    narrator """
    There, sitting right next to the local mechanic and right across from the butcher’s was Valentino’s, a small diner nearing the road to the residential areas and home to some of the best pies in town.

    Visiting it was almost a tradition between the two of us. No matter what time or occasion, be it something good or something bad, you could always find my uncle and me sitting down at one of the booths, eagerly awaiting our next slice.

    His cherry, mine a classic apple, I admit that we weren’t really the most inspired when it came down to our choice of desserts.

    But to us, it didn’t really matter, these pies were something special. Being pretty close friends with Mr. Valentino himself, my uncle was usually able to get a few extra slices on the house to take back home with us,

    and after eating to our heart’s content we would finally make our way to the final stop of our daily trip, the sea.
    """
    scene b_dock_blackwhite

    narrator """
    Walking down the road that led to the docks, we would make our ways towards the very edge and watch as the first rays of sunlight finally broke free from underneath the heavy clouds,

    causing the murky water to turn into a glimmering blue as the sun compelled it to life.

    Sitting down just mere inches away from the ocean’s surface, my uncle would stop to tell me stories about the town, his life, the things he saw out at sea.

    I remember one time asking him why he wasn’t afraid of being so close to the water, and he just smiled and looked at me. Ruffling my hair with his weathered hands, he laughed and told me that to him, the ocean was his life.

    It was something he had always known. He had been born by the sea, had built his life on the sea, and if need be, when the time comes, he had wanted to die by the sea.

    As we peered over the docks and into the water’s surface, our faces reflected on the cool and unbreaking surface, he told me that the sea, like all of those people my uncle had talked to on our way to get here, was just another friend waiting to meet us.

    All we had to do was reach out.

    narrator """
    My uncle had passed away not too long ago. He had gotten sick and I never really got ahold of the details.

    From what I had heard, it sounded like he was doing okay at first, but the longer his illness went on the weaker and weaker he became, until one day he had to close down his fishing business due to his health,

    and the next, and the next thing he knew he couldn’t even get out of bed anymore.

    I tried to visit him once I heard the news, but things back home had gotten so bad that by the time I had finally gotten the chance to see him, it was too late.

    Until my uncle’s passing, I hadn’t realized just how long I had been away from the place I considered my home, and although I’m finally here,

    I can’t help but look at the aging and weathered faces of the places we used to roam and realize that we could never relive those memories like we used to.

    Wiping the tears away from my cheeks, the cool ocean breeze making them icy to the touch, I kneel over the docks and come face to face with my reflection, the child I once knew now older and almost unrecognizable.

    Closing my eyes, I reach out and touch the water’s surface like my uncle had told me, like my uncle had used to do, and pay my respects to his memory.

    Getting back up to my feet, I retrace my steps and make my way back into town. The smell of sweet syrup and fresh bread wafting into the air as I pass by Valentino’s, my stomach growls and causes me to stop.

    Walking up the path that leads into Main Street, I walk as if in a trance, the people and places sweeping by all melding together into a haze.

    I’m lost in thoughts of the past, in thoughts of my uncle, my feet moving without any real purpose to their steps.

    Suddenly, the smell of sweet syrup and fresh bread wafting into the air serves to free me of my thoughts as I pass by Valentino’s, my stomach beginning to growl and forcing me to stop.

    I stand there in shocked silence, my eyes and likewise those of the diner’s patrons too enraptured by the sight of flying pans to think about food for the moment.

    Right, how could I forget...Valentino has an awful temper.

    He was always nice whenever my aunt or uncle showed up to eat, they were his loyal customers ever since he opened up his restaurant so he’s sort of developed a soft spot for them,

    but outside of that Valentino was a very, very prideful man when it came to his food.

    Once he got into one of his moods, he was guaranteed to continue until the end of service, if they were even able to complete one,

    and not wanting any more stress and doubting the speed in which I can get my much-awaited pie, I duck out of the diner almost as quickly as I had made my way in.

    It’s an old car, even by their standards, and yet my uncle had made sure to take care of it as much as possible.

    Thing is, my uncle at the time didn’t really know anything about cars, he was a fisherman after all, not a mechanic;

    and so, every week he would make the trip down to the mechanic’s in Main Street with whatever questions had popped up into mind.

    He had become such the regular that my uncle and the owner soon grew to think of each other as friends, something that I was made all too aware of with the countless hours of our daily walks spent talking to that owner and others just like him.

    It was through my uncle’s diligence that this ancient piece of machinery in the shape of a car was able to last for so long, but now, my uncle isn’t around anymore to fix it, and what Aunt Mildred and I had just gone through was the first result.

    The house had remained virtually untouched, the family portraits, the furniture, even the color of the wallpaper existing almost identically to those that I had seen when growing up.

    For several minutes I stay here like this, looking at the small objects that had served as small tidbits of my personal history before finally being called to the dining room,

    my stomach as equally as eager as I for the prospect of a warm meal after such a long day’s worth of travel.
